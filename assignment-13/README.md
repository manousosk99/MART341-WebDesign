
What is the goal of your website? (Think in terms of your user -- why might they visit your site?)
the purpose of my website is to show off air fried tofu. By showing it off I want to encourage people to think about tofu and hopefully make it. The reason for this is because I like tofu. The overall goal is to make an entertaining website that people will randomly stumble upon and have fun exploring.

Why is responsive web design important?
Its important because it allows a website to be viewed on any device without layout and display issues.
