How did your user testing sessions go? The testing sessions went really well, the users werent able to find any bugs and everything seemed to be working
What changes (if any) did you make to your website based on the user feedback you received? I received feedback to change color of certain things in order to aid with clarity, such as changing text color and revamping the submit button on the contact page. I also edited the share page to make it more realistic.
