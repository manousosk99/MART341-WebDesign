Tell me about a website you visited using The Wayback Machine.
What year was it from? How is the older version different from the new version in terms of its overall design?

I visited Youtube.com in 2012. The old version looks simpler with more buttons
to press. The design isn't as clean and sleek but it does have some nostalgia to it.
