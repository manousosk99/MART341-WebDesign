It was tedious to get ATOM to work with me and to get the website to do what I wanted. Forgetting a < > is annoying and makes the whole website not work properly. It was interesting to get a website working. I still find it hard to code a website the way I imagine it, I can't tell what the code is doing until I look at the website I am making.

I am not the best at decorating or giving style to stuff so I am not sure what to expect with CSS. My websites have been looking really bland though so I am looking forward to spicing them up.
