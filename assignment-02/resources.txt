1. A directory is like a folder because it holds files, expect for directories should be used when discussing file systems.

2. Version control systems (VCS) are useful because they help you keep track of the changes you make to your project over time. 
VCS allows you to view and compare different versions.

3. Using the broader definition of medium, I would say my favorite is shorter (6-20min) videos, especially on YouTube. 
I like shorter videos because if made well their content can be enterntaining, educational, news, etc. 
For example, I recently got into volleyball and short tutorial videos on YouTube have helped me improve my game.
